# Shreya's GitHub RAG Assistant

A LangGraph-powered Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers questions about Shreya Ramraika's( mine :) ) GitHub projects using AI-driven search and analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Repository Analysis**: Automatically loads and processes content from multiple GitHub repositories
- **Vector Search**: Uses semantic search to find relevant information across projects
- **Conversational Interface**: Interactive command-line chat for asking questions
- **Tool Integration**: LangGraph-powered agent that intelligently uses retrieval tools
- **Multi-Model Support**: Combines Google Gemini for reasoning and Ollama for embeddings

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google API key for Gemini
- Ollama installed locally with `nomic-embed-text` model

## 🎯 Usage

- "Tell me about her stock analysis project"
- Type `exit` or `quit` to end

## 🏗️ Architecture
